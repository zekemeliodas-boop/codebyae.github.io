i don't even know if you'll read this.
  but if you do. i just want you to say

that i'm really sorry and i still think about you sometimes
we both tried, we both cared.
but the universe gave us space to become us.
forever grateful because i met someone like you.

  i hope you're doing okay, even though we're not 
in each other arms anymore.
